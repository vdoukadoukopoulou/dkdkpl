				<p>
					films are like plants <br> they can’t grow without time <br> and light <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					the only difference between plants and films is that <br> film is dead <br> and plants are alive <br>
				</p>
				<p>
					Would it be possible to have an alive film ? <br> A film that grows as it is being ? <br> Something that has no set form ? <br>

					Algae are a very large and diverse group of eukaryotic <a target="_blank" class="tooltips circle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae">organisms<span>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae</span></a>. Algae are photosynthetic organisms that occur in most habitats, ranging from marine and freshwater to desert sands and from hot boiling springs to snow and ice. They vary from small, single-celled forms to complex multicellular forms, such as the giant kelps of the eastern Paci c that grow to more than 60 meters in length and form dense marine forests. Algae are found in the fossil record dating back to approximately 3 billion years in the Precambrian. They exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies, from simple, asexual cell division to complex forms of sexual <a target="_parent" class="tooltips circle" href="http://botany.si.edu/projects/algae/introduction.htm">reproduction<span>http://botany.si.edu/projects/algae/introduction.htm</span></a>. <i>algae is, at least the one i am living and working with, algae she is, single minded, strong minded and whole.</i>

				<p>The carbon dioxide is consumed by the algae which release oxygen. The bottle contains a solution of water, algae and nutrients.

				<p> what thought to be blooming algae turns out to be ‘duckweed’ → as a derivative it seems that there actually early any algae on the collection for the ‘oxygen set up’ Duckweeds, or water lens, are owering aquatic plants which oat on or just beneath the surface of still or slow-moving bodies of fresh water and wetlands</p>
				<p>there was another container collected that seemed to be a mix of algae and duckweed, dead the following day a er brought home</p>
				<p>bottles had to be refilled with water constantly especially bottle A , bottle B was doing better in the start now acts just like bottle A dead</p>
				<p>bottle A showed signs of fast algae growth but then remained stationary <br> it turns out to be some sort of slimy bio lm, not actual growth</p>
				<p>algae from the original collection small containers A & B show proper signs of growth <u><b>& seem alive</b></u></p>

				<p>the majority of the information I find is through aquarium maintenance forums perhaps, with that in mind I visited a aquarium supply store their aquarium had a little bit of algae growing on them, and they mostly sold stuff to kill algae, but I already do that for free however the rather helpful store manager provided me with a flyer identifying type of algae and product against. perhaps if I identify algae it will help me find the nutrients it’s missing or the environment it mind to remain alive</p>

				<p>Chlorella is a genus of single-cell green algae belonging to the phylum Chlorophyta. It is spherical in shape, about 2 to 10 μm in diameter, and is without agella. Chlorella contains the green photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll-a and -b in its chloroplast. rough photosynthesis, it multiplies rapidly, requiring only carbon dioxide, water, sunlight, and a small amount of minerals to <a target="_blank" class="tooltips circle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorella">reproduce<span>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorella</span></a></p>
