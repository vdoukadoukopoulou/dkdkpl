                <span id="title">breath one</span> was created as a part of <span id="location">MADCOW, a single night performance on the 29th of November 2013 at the Nieuwe Persvoeder Fabriek in Veghel,Netherlands.
            The project was made possible with the kind support of Kunstgroep de Compagnie. With special thanks to Henk van Wanrooij.</span>

                in the form of a soft > plastic performative installation, breath one explored the differences between the industrial architectural space and the tactile materiality of it. When the performance comes to its end the space swifts into darkness for the last
                time, stomping noises appear, walking, running ; the spectators’ attention is drawn upwards, to the previously unexplored top floors, suddenly made aware of the size of the tower, 10 floors high, as bright white construction light goes
                switches on and the place deeps into silence only for the breath of the performer standing on the fifth floor funnel platform to be heard—breathe in breathe out— the breathing is amplified by the acoustic of the metal construction; eventually
                a clear plastic bag, that resembles a silo storing bag is dropped, filled with the performers breaths swirling through the air until it hits the ground marking the end of the performance. <span id="sup"> <sup> 1 </sup> </span>
